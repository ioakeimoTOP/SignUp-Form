# SignUp Form

An implementation of the Sign Up form [design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png) provided by TOP curriculum.

The implementation slightly deviates from the provided mockup by extending the functionality to create a bigger challenge and provide further skill-set development.

The implemented form, as can be seen in the [live demo](https://ioakeimotop.github.io/SignUp-Form/), should be responsive, visibly communicate interactable parts, communicate input validation issues and be *somewhat* accessible (since accessibility is scheduled to be a topic of in-depth study later in the TOP curriculum).
